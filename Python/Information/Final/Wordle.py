# Create hangman game where a random word from a list is 
# selected and the user needs to guess the correct word by inputting the different letters that it is formed by. 
# The user has a limited set of guessed (maximum 6) and each time they guess correctly the updated word must be printed on screen. 
# (Example: "guessed letter: p" -> "output: P_ _ _ _ _", "guessed letter: t" -> "output: P_ T_ _ _" â€¦)
